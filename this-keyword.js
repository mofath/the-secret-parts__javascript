Execution context (scope) is the environment in which a pieced of code is executed and evaluated at.
By environment, I mean the value of this, variables, objects, and functions JavaScript code has access to at a particular time.

Execution context in JavaScript is of three types as:

1- Global execution context (GEC): All of the global code i.e. code which is not inside any function or object is executed inside the global execution context.
GEC cannot be more than one because only one global environment is possible for JS code execution as the JS engine is single threaded.

2- Functional execution context (FEC): Each function has its own execution context. It can be more than one. 
Functional execution context has access to all the code of the global execution context. 
In the browser context, if the code is executing in strict mode value of this is undefined else it is window object in the function execution context.

3- Eval: Execution context inside eval function.

Execution context stack (ECS): stores all the execution stacks created during the life cycle of the script.
Global execution context is present by default in execution context stack and it is at the bottom of the stack. 

JavaScript engine creates the execution context in two stages:

Creation phase: in which the JS engine has called a function but its execution has not started. 
In the creation phase, JS engine is in the compilation phase and it doesnâ€™t execute any code.

In the creation phase, JS engine performs the following task:
1 - Creates the Variable object(Activation object):  is a special object which contain all the variables, function arguments and inner functions declaration information. 
it is a special object it does not have the dunder proto property.

2- Creates the scope chain: Once the variable object gets created, the JS engine initializes the scope chain which is a list of all the variables objects inside which the current function exists. 
This also includes the variable object of the global execution context. Scope chain also contains the current function variable object.

3- Determines the value of this: After the scope chain, the JavaScript engine initializes the value of this.

Variable object or variable object contains the argument object which has details about the arguments of the function.


Function definitions in the creation phase are stored in heap memory, they are not stored in the execution context stack. 
Function name property points to its definition in the heap memory.

Execution phase:

In the execution phase, JS engines will again scan through the function to update the variable object with the values of the variables and will execute the code.
